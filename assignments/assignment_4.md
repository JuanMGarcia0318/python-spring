## Assignment

You are considering to visit Bush Gardens, and would like to plan your day. You know which rides you want to take, and how often. You also have an estimate of the time it takes (including wait time) for each ride. For example, one ride on the Tigris will take 30 minutes, two rides one hour, etc. 


```python
howmanyrides = {
    "Tigris": 2,
    "Cheetah Hunt": 1,
    "Sheikra": 3,
    "Congo River Rapids": 2
}

time = {
    "Tigris": 60,
    "Cheetah Hunt": 45,
    "Sheikra": 30,
    "Congo River Rapids": 30
}
```

### Required
